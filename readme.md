what you implement?
Execution Time Measurement: You measure the execution time for both recursive and iterative approaches, which highlights the efficiency of the iterative version for large n.

Generate Fibonacci Numbers up to a Limit: fibonacci_up_to_n generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a specified value,n, using  an itrative approach.

Ratios Approaching the Golden Ratio: fibonacci_ratios calculates the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers, which approaches the golden ratio as the sequence progresses.
