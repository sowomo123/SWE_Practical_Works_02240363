# lab 8 question
1 Implement an in-place version of Quick Sort to improve its space efficiency.
2 Modify Bubble Sort to stop early if the list becomes sorted before all passes are complete.
3 Implement a hybrid sorting algorithm that uses Insertion Sort for small subarrays in Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
4 Create a visualization of how each sorting algorithm works using a library like Matplotlib.
 # what you implement?
i have iplemented : Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
